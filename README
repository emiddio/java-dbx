The java-libdbx package is a set of structure-like classes that load data from
an Outlook Express .dbx database file and can parse the data accordingly.

The project is an implementation in Java of the .dbx file format that was
found by the work of Arne Schloh: http://oedbx.aroh.de/

The main class, OEReader, is used to load a file and read the messages from
it, whereas the other classes are subclasses that are used either in
parsing or in structuring the extracted data. Each class stores extracted
data in a number of public variables which can be extracted by the user.

NOTE: This parser is NOT complete. It is missing the implementation of the
Deleted and Conditions objects.

===== Usage =====
Under Example folder you can find code to get how to use this library.

Generally, you want to create an OEReader object, load a file with the
open(...) method, and then call getMessages()  or getFolders() to retrieve
information from the .dbx Outlook Express file.
