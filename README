===== Description =====
The OEReader package is a set of structure-like classes that load data from an
Outlook Express .dbx database file and can parse the data accordingly.

The project is an implementation in Java of the .dbx file format that was
found by the work of Arne Schloh: http://oedbx.aroh.de/

The main class, OEReader, is used to load a file and read the messages from it,
whereas the other classes are subclasses that are used either in parsing or in
structuring the extracted data. Each class stores extracted data in a number of
public variables which can be extracted by the user.

NOTE: This parser is NOT complete. It is missing the implementation of the
FolderInfo, Deleted, and Conditions objects, as well as parsing of the folder
files fully. This was making the assumption that almost all people would only care
about getting the messages out of the message file. If there is need for the
full implementation of the library, email me (my email is below) and I will
put the time in to finish the implementation. It doesn't exactly require much more
time, but it is a bit laborious.


===== Libraries =====
This package uses only Java standard libraries; no external libraries are needed
on the classpath!


===== Usage =====
Download and open the javadoc folder in the master branch, or read the javadoc
online at http://java-oe-reader.sourceforge.net

Generally, you want to create an OEReader object, load a file with the open(...)
method, and then call getMessages() to retrieve an array of OEMessageInfo objects,
containing all the information from all of the messages in the .dbx Outlook
Express file.
